The code to generate the catalogue is in the directory generate_catalogue.
It reads the data from the Google spreadsheet and performs a number of quality checks.
It outputs several versions:
- amcvn_catalogue_confirmed.fits and amcvn_catalogue_candidate.fits are final versions to be uploaded
- amcvn_catalogue_secret.fits is a more-complete but less-tidy version used to generate figures
- for_gaia_upload.fits is the version to be used for the Gaia and distance crossmatch.

In summary_figures are several scripts to produce summary figures of the sample, which are also to be uploaded.

In references is a Latex file to produce a table of references. The file 'references.txt' (output by generate_catalogue.py)
contains an auto-generated Latex table that you can copy into 'references.tex'. You may need to tidy it a bit.
