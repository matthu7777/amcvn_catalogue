The code to generate the catalogue is in the directory generate_catalogue.
It reads the data from the Google spreadsheet and performs a number of quality checks.
It also does the Gaia crossmatch.
It outputs a file named 'amcvn_catalogue.fits'.

In summary_figures are several scripts to produce summary figures of the sample, which are also to be uploaded.

In references is a Latex file to produce a table of references. The file 'references.txt' (output by generate_catalogue.py)
contains an auto-generated Latex table that you can copy into 'references.tex'. You may need to tidy it a bit.


Overall proces:
Update the online spreadsheet.
Run the script "generate_catalogue/generate_catalogue.py"
Create figures (various python scripts in "summary_figures")
Update references file ("references/references.tex") with latex table from "generate_catalogue/references.txt"
Upload to Zenodo.
